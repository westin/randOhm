Sketch Plugin: randOhm
======
A Sketch plugin to clone, randomly rotate, and randomly distribute layers around an artboard

## USAGE
 
1. Put the layers you're working with in an artboard
2. Select the layers you’d like to use
3. Launch the plug-in (Plugins --> randOhm), then select your options:
  - *Enter how many copies you’d like*
    - *(or, to just randomly distribute the current selected layers, enter 0)*
  - *Allow or disallow random rotation during distribution*
  - *Choose if the layers should stay contained within the artboard, or overlap along the edges a bit*

## INSTALLATION
Download and double click randOhm.sketchplugin to install. Could it be any simpler? You'll see it within your Plugin menu in Sketch. 

## ETC
I built this because I wanted to create a sky with thousands of little stars, but there was no way to do this quickly and easily. So, bam.
