Sketch Plugin: randOhm
======
Sketch plugin to clone and randomly distribute layers within an artboard

## Usage
 
1. Put the layers you’d like to be randomly repeated and distributed within an artboard
2. Select the layers you’d like to be repeated and distributed
3. Launch the plug-in (Plugins --> randOhm), then select your options:
  - *Enter how many copies you’d like to be distributed*
    - *(to just randomly distribute the selected layers without copying, enter **0**)*
  - *Choose if you’d like the layers to be randomly rotated during distribution*
  - *Choose if the layers should stay contained within the artboard, or be allowed to overlap along the edges a bit*

## Installation
Download and double click randOhm.sketchplugin to install. Could it be any simpler? You'll see it within your Plugin menu in Sketch. 

## Etc
I built this because I wanted to create a sky with thousands of little stars, but there was no way to do this quickly and easily. So, bam.
